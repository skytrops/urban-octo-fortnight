# ESRB Video Game Rating Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) video game ratings and the associated content features of various video games. The objective is to gain insights into the distribution of ESRB ratings, understand the prevalence of specific content features across different rating categories, and develop a machine learning model to predict ESRB ratings based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about video games, including their ESRB ratings and various content features. The ratings include categories such as:
- **E (Everyone)**
- **ET (Early Teens)**
- **T (Teen)**
- **M (Mature)**

## Questions and Objectives

1. **What is the distribution of ESRB ratings in the dataset?**
   - Determine the number of games in each rating category.
   - Create a bar plot to visualize the distribution.

2. **Are there any specific ESRB content features that are more prevalent in certain rating categories?**
   - Analyze the frequency of each content feature for different ESRB ratings.
   - Identify significant differences in content features across rating categories.

3. **Is there a correlation between the presence of certain content features (e.g., violence, sexual content) and the assigned ESRB rating?**
   - Analyze the correlation between content features and ESRB ratings.
   - Determine if certain features are strong indicators of specific rating categories.

4. **Can you identify any patterns in the relationship between ESRB ratings and the presence of multiple content features?**
   - Explore combinations of content features and their prevalence in different rating categories.
   - Identify common patterns and relationships.

5. **How well can the ESRB rating be predicted based on the presence of different content features?**
   - Build a classification model to predict ESRB ratings using the available content features.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning model development


## Results

- The distribution of ESRB ratings was visualized using bar plots.
- The analysis revealed significant differences in content features across different rating categories.
- A correlation analysis highlighted strong indicators of specific ESRB ratings based on content features.
- Patterns in the relationship between multiple content features and ESRB ratings were identified.
- A machine learning classification model was developed to predict ESRB ratings with satisfactory performance metrics.
